# Awesome List of Information Security Advent Activities

![awesome infosec banner of a wreath, christmas balls, and security icons](infosec_advent_2024.png)

For the last few years I have struggled to find Information Security specific Advent events that were both accessable and well used.  After years of my coder friends having plenty of options and flavors I decided to do some digging and list out what I find and what is shared with me.

I settled on TryHackMe's Advent of Cyber in 2023 and lost interest half way through.  

I will work on a How to Contribute and other things as I can but I am happy to take suggestions and PRs here or on Mastodon [@leerayl@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@leerayl)

If you want to join me in 2024, I will be doing the [TryHackMe Advent of Cyber](https://tryhackme.com/r/christmas) and you can add me if you would like: [leerayl](https://tryhackme.com/r/p/leerayl)
